This Python script is meant to calculate "Code Rank" for files in a Python repository. This script will:

1.  Discover all Python files (`.py`) in a given repository directory.
2.  Parse each file to find its import statements.
3.  Resolve imports to fully qualified module names, including relative imports.
4.  Build two directed graphs:
    * `G_imports`: An edge `A -> B` exists if module `A` imports module `B`.
    * `G_imported_by`: An edge `B -> A` exists if module `A` imports module `B` (equivalent to `G_imports` with edges reversed).
5.  Specified external modules (e.g., `sklearn`, `numpy`) are included as nodes in these graphs. Imports of these contribute to the rank, with configurable weights.
6.  Calculate PageRank on both graphs:
    * `PR_being_imported(M)`: Score for module `M` based on how many important modules import `M` (from `G_imports`).
    * `PR_importing_others(M)`: Score for module `M` based on `M` importing other important modules (from `G_imported_by`).
7.  The final "Code Rank" for an internal module is the sum of these two PageRank scores.
8.  Output a ranked list of internal modules and their Code Rank scores.

**Key Features & Design Choices:**

* **AST Parsing**: Uses Python's `ast` module for parsing import statements. This is generally robust but might not cover all edge cases handled by more sophisticated tools like `pydeps` or `modulegraph` (especially around `sys.path` modifications, `.pth` files, or complex namespace packages).
* **Module Name Resolution**: Converts file paths to fully qualified module names (e.g., `package.subpackage.module`). It handles `__init__.py` files correctly to represent packages.
* **Relative Imports**: The script attempts to resolve relative imports (e.g., `from .sibling import X`, `from ..package import Y`).
* **External Modules**: Allows specifying a list of external libraries. Imports from these libraries will influence the scores of internal modules. The contribution from/to external modules can be weighted differently.
* **PageRank**: Uses the `networkx` library for PageRank calculations.
* **"Importance Flows Both Ways"**: This is achieved by summing two PageRank scores:
    1.  How much a module *is imported* by important modules.
    2.  How much a module *imports* important modules.
    This directly addresses the requirements: "if a module is importing from a lot of other modules, then it's relevant. And it's also relevant, of course, if a lot of other modules are importing it."
* **Configurable Weights**: Allows setting weights for internal vs. external links in the graph.


**Explanation of Weights:**

* `--weight_internal` (default 1.0): Standard weight for links between modules within your repository.
* `--weight_external_import` (default 0.5): When an internal module `A` imports an external module `E` (`A -> E` in `G_imports`), this weight applies. A lower value means external modules "absorb" less rank from your internal modules.
* `--weight_external_dependency` (default 0.5): When an internal module `A` imports an external module `E`, this creates a conceptual link `E -> A` in the `G_imported_by` graph. This weight applies to that link. A lower value means importing an external module gives a smaller "boost" to module `A`'s "importing activity" score compared to importing an internal module. This directly addresses the requirement: "...this should contribute less than the intra-repo imports."

**Further Considerations/Improvements:**

* **Advanced Import Resolution**: For very complex projects (e.g., using `sys.path` manipulation, namespace packages, editable installs), the `ast`-based parsing might miss some imports or resolve them incorrectly. Using libraries like `pydeps` or `modulegraph` internally could provide more accuracy.
* **Granularity of External Modules**: Currently, `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression` links to the `sklearn` node. You could modify it to link to `sklearn.linear_model` if desired, making external nodes more granular.
* **Standard Library**: Imports from the Python standard library (e.g., `os`, `json`, `collections`) are currently ignored unless explicitly listed in `external_modules`. You could add a generic "std_lib" node or handle them differently.
* **Dynamic Imports**: `importlib.import_module()` or `__import__()` calls are not detected.
* **Error Handling**: More robust error handling for file I/O and parsing.
* **Performance**: For extremely large repositories, optimizing file discovery and parsing might be necessary. `os.walk` and `ast` are reasonably fast, though.
* **Visualization**: The `networkx` graphs (`G_imports`) could be visualized using `matplotlib` or exported to formats like GraphML for analysis in tools like Gephi.
* **Alternative Ranking**: Instead of summing two PageRank scores, one could explore other ways to combine them or use different graph algorithms if the current "CodeRank" definition doesn't perfectly match intuition for a specific use case.
* **Impact of `__init__.py` at repo root**: The `path_to_module_fqn` currently returns `None` for an `__init__.py` directly in the repository root. This means it won't be part of the analysis. This is often fine, as such files are more about making the directory a package for external use rather than being a module with internal dependencies in the same way other files are. If this needs to be included, a specific naming convention for it would be required.
